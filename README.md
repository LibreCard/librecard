 A more secure and private note card app

## What is librecard?
librecard is a note card app that is more secure and private than other note card apps. 

## How does it work?
librecard uses a combination of AES-256 encryption and a password to encrypt your notes. The encryption key is derived from your password using the PBKDF2 algorithm. The encryption key is then used to encrypt your notes using AES-256. and then save it to either to your own device or to our servers.
